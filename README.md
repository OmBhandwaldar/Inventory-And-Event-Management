# PCCOE Inventory and Event Management System

## Introduction

Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering (PCCOE) organizes various events and activities across different branches, requiring significant coordination in managing resources, booking locations (halls, classrooms), obtaining permissions, and keeping faculty and students informed. Currently, many of these processes are handled manually, leading to inefficiencies and delays. To streamline these operations, there is a need for an online inventory and event management system that handles the full cycle of event planning, resource management, and communication between departments, students, and staff.

## Solution Expected

The proposed solution is a web-based application that automates the process of resource booking, event organization, and inventory management for PCCOE. Key features include:

- **Inventory Management**: Manage inventory such as event materials, marketing supplies, and stationery. Track requests from various departments and keep stock levels updated.
  
- **Event and Resource Booking**: Allow staff and departments to request the booking of venues (halls, classrooms, labs) for events or lectures. The system should handle approvals and scheduling conflicts automatically.
  
- **Permission Requests**: Automate the process of seeking necessary permissions for event organization from department heads, faculty, and administrative offices.
  
- **Communication Tools**: Send automated notifications and updates to students, faculty, and relevant staff members about upcoming events, resource bookings, and any changes in schedules.
  
- **Report Generation**: Generate reports on inventory consumption, branch-wise and employee-wise, and provide an overview of resource utilization for events and activities.
